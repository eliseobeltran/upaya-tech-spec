# Product API
~~We'll need an endpoint to create and update `Products` in our product catalog in order to sync them with the product catalog in Guidebook.~~

Products will be managed manually through NetSuite's web interface; there is no need for endpoints to keep the two systems in sync.

Historical documentation around the proposed `Product` endpoint [can be found here](https://github.com/cooncesean/upaya-tech-spec/blob/4066c3f40fc928dbb850329b1e692cce3f6e1062/product.md).
